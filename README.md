# Lead-Scoring-using-Logistic-Regression

The problem statement of the case study revolved around an education company named X Education that sells online courses to industry professionals. X Education faced a problem of getting a lot of leads, but the lead conversion rate being very poor. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’.

X Education appointed us to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.

Our end-goal is to build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert and vice versa.
